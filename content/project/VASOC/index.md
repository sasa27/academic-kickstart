VASOC (017 January-  2020 June) Coordinator: S. Salva

Purposes: The project aims to educate and raise awareness among developers and industrials on the security of IOTs. The project will bring solutions to the realisation of a strict security audit process allowing to evaluate IOTs under development or existing IOTs. The project will provide tools (model learning, testing tools) in this purpose. It will also facilitate the emergence of a team of industrials and researchers experts in this topic in the French region Auvergne Rhone-Alpes.
